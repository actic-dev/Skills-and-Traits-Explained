Can be added and removed from existing save files at any time.

# Translations

Trait descriptions will be translated automatically. If you have additional trait mods installed, they should work as long as the mod itself supports your language.
Skill descriptions are maintained by myself. If you want to contribute to translating this skill descriptions to your language, you're welcome to do so!

**Currently supported Language(s)**

-   English
-   German (will be added soon)

# Planned Features

-   Add detailed percentage values of how each skill level affects the character
-   Add Option to toggle detailed values on or off (This mod is aimed towards casual players, therefore i don't want to overwhelm players with numbers by default)
