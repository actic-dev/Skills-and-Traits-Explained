Yes!

[h1]Translations[/h1]

Trait descriptions will be translated automatically. If you have additional trait mods installed, they should work as long as the mod itself supports your language.
Skill descriptions are maintained by myself. If you want to contribute to translating the skill descriptions to your language, you're welcome to do so!
